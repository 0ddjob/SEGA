# Sega Projects
The Sega Saturn was my first console (apart from my dad's Atari 2600), so has a special place in memory.<br>

## Sega Mark III
### [RGB amplifier](https://github.com/0ddjob/SEGA/tree/main/Mark_III/RGB_Amp)<br>
An internal & external RGB video signal amplifier.<br>

## Sega SC-3000
I did start working on a homebrew SC-3000 ... but an already, far-superior [version](https://github.com/barbeque/sg1000) based on the SG-1000 has already been created.  You just need to add an SK-1100 keyboard ... DIY version also under development.<br>

## Sega Saturn
### [Windows Communication Cable](https://github.com/0ddjob/SEGA/tree/main/Saturn/Windows_Communication_Cable)<br>
